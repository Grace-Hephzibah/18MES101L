Point a -> 15mm above HP and 40mm infront of VP -> 
1st quadrant 

Point b -> 20mm above HP and 40mm behind VP -> 
2nd quadrant

Point c -> 40mm below HP and 40mm infront of VP -> 
4th quadrant 

Point d -> 25mm below HP and 20mm behind VP -> 
3rd quadrant 

Notes:

* Above and Behind means Above the XY Plane
* Below and Infront means Below the XY Plane 

Assignment Questions:

Point A, which is 40mm above HP and 55mm infront of VP
Point B, which is 10mm above HP and 15mm behind VP
Point C, which is 25mm below HP and 29mm behind VP
Point D, which is 20mm below HP and 20mm infront of VP	

Second part

Line AB 75mm long makes 45 degree inclination with VP while 
its Front view makes 55 degree. End A is 10mm above HP and 
15mm infront of VP. If line is in 1st quadrant. Draw it's 
projection and find it's inclination with HP.


Given:
True Length : 75mm
45 inclination with VP
55 inclination in front view

End of A is 10mm above HP 
            15mm infront of VP
